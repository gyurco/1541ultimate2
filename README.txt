Overview of the EAPI versions
=============================

V1: not contained in any public firmware
V2: 1st released version - IIRC only in my firmware build.
V3: Widely used.
V4: Fixed a bun within INIT of EAPI. Not contained in any firmware because of V5.
V5: Support for newer FPGA on 1541 Ultimate side. Therefore mich faster in erasing sectors.
